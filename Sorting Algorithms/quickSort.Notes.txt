Quick sort follows a recursive algorithm. We find the pivot which divides the array into two halves. Anything to the left of the pivot is less than the pivot value, anything
to the right is greater.

Left pointer and right pointer assigned to either end of the list. The values are compared; if the right pointer's values is less than the left pointer's, they are swapped.
The left pointer remains in its position whilst the right pointer moves another.
